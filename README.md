This SQL file includes a database for a IT support company. This tracks aspects of the IT company such as
	•	Clients
	•	Users
	•	Technicians
	•	Support tickets
	•	Devices
	•	Technician Skills
	•	Contracts
	•	Invoices
	•	Services
	•	Ticket Logs and services
  
I proceeded to use sample data to make buisness analyzations of trends and make relevant observations. 
I created the data using AI so that it would be somewhat "messy data". Which allowed me to practice "cleaning" it to be able
to utilize it properly. 
One of the queries that were notable were ticket growth by month. This allows to envision 
the growth analysis and track how much the company is growing over time numerically. As well as, forecast staffing needs and possibly
look into what is triggering this growth. Which leads to the observation of which clients submit the most support tickets. 
This can give insight into issues such as device vulnerabilities or even which OS versions are the most problematic for companies usage.
Given this data, it is clear the Windows 11 is one of the more problematic devices for companies. This can suggest possibly updating their
devices or OS. Additionally the data has shown the Acme Corporation and Beta Teck LLC have submitted the most support tickets. This suggests that
the IT company could possibly pivot and reevalute current contracts that are made with these certain clients. With the influx of tickets
from specific companies consistenly, it may be time to revisit pricing and negotiate the contracts further. Then, it was relevant look into the data within 
the technicians. To see how they are handling the support tickets and workload. I found that the senior technicians closed 16 tickets, and the
average resolution time was 42.94 hours. Additionally, the mid technicians were not far behind with 14 closed tickets and an average resoltuion time of 132 hours. 
This insight allows the IT company to take a look at differing levels of skill and their capabilities. The senior technicians are extremely efficient in the resolution of tickets. 
This can suggest promotion and possible staffing decisions based on levels of productivity. Another useful metric is making sure the work is evenly distrubuted among the 
technicians. Some technicians have 12 tickets and others have 1. Whilst they are differing in levels of experience and skill level, it is important to ensure the technicians are not
overwokring. That can lead to drop of quality, or time spent evaluating each ticket request. 
Overall creating, cleaning, and the analysis of this database has allowed for 
useful insights into what upgrades or evaluations this company can make based off of this sample data. As well as utitlizing tools like Power BI and Tableau 
to put this data into context and create visuals to then present on a dashboard.
